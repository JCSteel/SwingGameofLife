# SwingGameOfLife
CS3398 Software Engineering Project 1: Game of Life

TO RUN THE APP: 
- Use the files provided in the GameOfLife-Jarod folder. 
- The code was written in the Eclipse IDE, so you can download the files and import them as a new project in Eclipse to run the app. 
- You can also run the application from the command line if desired. 
  - Note: Be sure to compile and run the application when you are located in the src directory of the project. 

NOTES: 

The source code for the application is located in and only in the GameOfLife-Jarod folder. 

The GameofLifee folder holds a version of the Board and BoardDB classes originally uploaded by William. His classes were then modified and added to the GameOfLife-Jarod folder to complete the source code. Therefore, the files inside the GameofLifee folder don't have to be compiled and run. We are just leaving them up so William's contribution can be seen on GitHub. 

Also, the BoardCanvas.java file doesn't need to be compiled and run either. The parts of its code that we used for the application are all included in the source code in the GameOfLife-Jarod folder. It only remains up so that team member contributions can be seen.
